## Overview

This project involved building a professional profile website using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and GitHub Pages. The website includes personal information, resume, API integrations, JavaScript cookies, and interactive features. Through this assignment, I learned how to build and deploy a responsive web application and apply core web programming concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and web API integration.
